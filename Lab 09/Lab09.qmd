## PDB database composition statistics

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
```

Q1:The percentage of structures solved by X-ray and electron microscopy is:

```{r}
pdbstats[,] <- lapply(pdbstats, function(x) as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))
total = sum(pdbstats$Total)
percentage = round(c(sum(pdbstats$X.ray),sum(pdbstats$EM)) / total *100, 2)
```

Based on the answer, there are 85.52% from X-ray structures and 7.48% from electron microscopy.

Q2: The proportion of protein structures in PDB:

```{r}
percentage = round(sum(pdbstats[1,7]) / total *100, 2)
```

Based on the answer, there are 86.81% of proteins (only) in PDB.

Q3: Based on the result from PDB website, there are 4929 structures of HIV protease structures in current PDB.

# Visualizing the HIV-1 protease

Q4: The water molecules are being simplified for a better visualizationof the protein itself.

Q5: The critical conserved water molecule has the residue number of 509, which is in the middle of Photoporphyrin IX.

Q6:indinavir or larger ligands and substranst might entering the binding site through the gap between the two proteins.

# Introduction to Bio3D

```{r}
library(bio3d)
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

Q7: Number of amino acid residues on this PDB is 198.

Q8: The non-protein residues are HOH and MK1.

Q9: The number of protein chains in this structure is 2.

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

# Predicting functional motions of a single structure

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <-nma(adk)
plot(m)
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

# Comparative structure analysis of Adenylate Kinase

```{r}
#install.packages("bio3d")
#install.packages("devtools")
#install.packages("BiocManager")

#BiocManager::install("msa")
#devtools::install_bitbucket("Grantlab/bio3d-view")
```

Q10: package msa is found only on BioConductor not CRAN.

Q11: the bio3d-view is not found in either BioConductor or CRAN.

Q12: It would be True that funcitons can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket.

```{r}
library(bio3d)
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```

Q13: The sequence in total is 214 aa long.

```{r}
# Blast or hmmer search 
#b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
# Plot a summary of search results
#hits <- plot(b)
```

```{r}
# List out some 'top hits'
#head(hits$pdb.id)
```

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Align releated PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

```{r}
# Vector containing PDB codes for figure axis
ids <- basename.pdb(pdbs$id)

# Draw schematic alignment
#plot(pdbs, labels=ids) # Commented due to margin errors
```

```{r}
anno <- pdb.annotate(ids)
unique(anno$source)
anno
```

```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
# Calculate RMSD
rd <- rmsd(pdbs)

# Structure-based clustering
hc.rd <- hclust(dist(rd))
grps.rd <- cutree(hc.rd, k=3)

plot(pc.xray, 1:2, col="grey50", bg=grps.rd, pch=21, cex=1)
```
